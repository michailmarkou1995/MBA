"This dissertation analyzes the role of technology in global business operations in Industry 4.0, focusing on the potential benefits and challenges of using Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO), WEB3.0, Human Resource Management Algorithmic Systems (HRMS), and enterprise architecture methodologies such as ITIL, TOGAF, and SAFe. Through a literature review, this study finds that these technologies and methodologies can enhance efficiency, data management, decision-making, and collaboration. However, challenges such as security, interoperability, and ethical implications related to algorithmic decision-making must be addressed. This research provides insights into how companies can leverage these technologies and methodologies while minimizing risks and challenges. The findings contribute to understanding the role of technology and methodologies in global business operations and offer recommendations for companies to gain a competitive advantage."
