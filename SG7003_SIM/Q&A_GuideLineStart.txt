Which is the country of the market? 

Does brand logo change influence the algorithm (real world scenario that would be bad!) 

A press release before the new round starts does take into account? 

If i adjsut the value (lower the price) in order to stay competitive and make a campaign or press release about my move will the algorithm consider it? And not give bad impression to customers? Because sneakers have context as value. 

If a release to a new market e.g., kids will in Decisions -> Managment Sections Market analysis for kids will take place first? Or the next year? (how algorithm takes that into account?) 

R&D researchers are my inlcuded in (9) total number of employees or are they extra? (staff section)
